akka-v2-contrib-osgi
====================

Sample Akka OSGi packaging using Maven/Karaf

DEPRECATED
----------

This project was only applicable to the Akka v2.0.X code base.  In v2.1, OSGi
support is intrinsic and, as such, the efforts here are no longer needed.

However, this repository will remain online for the slim chance it helps
someone out who is on the Akka v2.0.X branch.  Once the Akka team officially
retires that branch, this repository will be removed so as to minimize any
confusion its presence could contribute.

Hopefully this simple effort has helped someone out there!
